        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I'm an engineering student from Lebanon with a passion for robotics and engineering. My journey in engineering started when 
          i fell in love with Formula 1 racing cars and their complex design but that was when i turned 15, brfore that i use
           to take apart toy cars and anything which had a mechanism and a battery in it and thats where the actual journey began.</p>
